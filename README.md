This is a simple learning experience that quickly teaches the basics of CSS
selectors. It assumes familiarity with basic HTML.

The experience has been designed to work well on both mobile and desktop
devices. As a result, large "shortcut" buttons are available to input
keystrokes like `#` and `.`, which are typically challenging to type
on mobile devices. The only keys the player should ever have to directly
tap on their device's keyboard are the lowercase alphabet and the space bar.

The software has been tested to work on:

* Desktop Firefox
* Desktop Safari
* Mobile Safari
